**What did you do this past week?**
This week I tried to find a partner for the Netflix project. I know a few people in the class but wanted to work with someone I don’t know. Unfortunately I wasn’t able to find anyone to work with. I tried talking to people after class and posting on piazza but everyone I talked to already had partners and no one responded to my piazza post. I have started working on the project by myself and made a good amount of progress. The actual math/algorithms behind the rating predictions is much easier than I expected but setting up everything has been a lot of work.

**What's in your way?**
Finding a partner. Also learning to write a makefile. I mostly copied from the Collatz assignment but I’ve never even edited a makefile before so it was a learning experience. This made  getting Travis CI to run my tests difficult

**What will you do next week?**
Finish Netflix project. Right now I have a very basic algorithm that predict the same number every time, 3.7. I have most of my tests and stuff written and need to work on my prediction algorithm now. 

**My Experience**
I wish I had been able to find a partner for the project, but I really liked class this week. The talk by the developer from Bloomberg was interesting and I really like the Netflix project. I have been curious as to how it works.


**Tip of the Week**
I started using PyCharm this week, it’s really nice, and free.
