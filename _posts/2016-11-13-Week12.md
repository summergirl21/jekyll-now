**What did you do this past week?**
This past week I mostly worked on stuff for my other classes. I had a big project due for another class so didn’t work a whole lot on our project.

**What's in your way?**
I’m not sure what is a good way for me to contribute to the project. Last project I mostly wrote unit tests. I should work on that again for this project but am having some trouble figuring out how to write tests for our new things. I am not familiar with really any of the tools we’ve been using for our project so it has been a learning experience and a real struggle figuring out how to work with them.

**What will you do next week?**
We need to finish the last project. I think the search part is done now, it was a lot easier than I thought it would be. The main part we still need to work on is the front end, testing and the wiki. I will probably we working mostly on testing. 

**My Experience**
The quizzes recently have been hard. The materiel the last few weeks has been interesting. I’m enjoying learning more about databases and java and refactoring and not just python. I especially enjoy learning about the refactoring. That is something that I think is important and will be useful to me in a real world job and I probably won’t learn about it in any of my other classes. I want to look up the book that the examples came from so I can learn more about refactoring.

**Pick of the Week**
I found some useful tutorials and information about D3.js that should be useful for the next project.
