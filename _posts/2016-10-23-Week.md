**What did you do this past week?**
This past week I went to the Grace Hopper Celebration of women in computer science, so didn’t do a whole lot for the project. Last week my team decided on a topic and started our project. I started learning about flask and some of the tools we’re using but didn’t have much time this week because of Grace Hopper.

**What's in your way?**
As always having enough time, I need to catch up from Grace Hopper. I have a lot of homework to do this week but should have more time this week to work on this class.

**What will you do next week?**
Next week I’ll review the material I missed last week and start working on the next project. Hopefully will be able to meet in person this week to work on our project but will probably prioritize some of my other work that's due this week.


**My Experience**
We just got our test grades back, I hope that I can get some specific feedback on my test and what exactly I should have done differently, don’t know if that will happen since the test was on canvas. I find getting specific feedback really useful like would normally on a test with at least knowing which questions I got points off and hopefully knowing specifically what I did wrong would be useful for me.


**Pick of the Week**
Found a slack bot to integrate Travis CI in slack.
