**What did you do this past week?**
I got really busy this week so haven't set up docker yet but am planing to do that later today. In class we went over some examples that gave me some ideas on where to start on the project in order to make it efficient enough. I have a rought idea of what I want to do for the project once I actually start.

**What's in your way?**
Time, I need to actually schedule some time to sit down and work on the project. I've been busy with homework and other stuff and just putting it off.

**What will you do next week?**
Get docker and the other softwares working and finish the project

**My Experience**
I think there was some very usefull bits in the lectures this week. For example the explanations of forking on github and the differences between is and == in python and .equal and == in java. Overall I feel like so far we are just covering the basics and a lot of the things I know already from previous CS classes and my experience programing in python in high school.

**Tip of the Week**
Don't procrastinate, stay foucused when coding.
