**What did you do this past week?**
This week I worked on the Collatz project. It was a fun project but I started kinda late so it was rushed especially because mostof the tools were new to me.

**What's in your way?**
Again time, I just need to get caught up so I can start the next project earier. Also learning the tools better would help.

**What will you do next week?**
Read the next project assignment and get started with it.

**My Experience**
The discutions of some of the data structures in python in class this week was interesting especially the parts about how mutable and imutable objects behave differently. But overall so far I feel that this class has just foucused on rather specific bits of information specific to python that I can easly find online. Hopefully we start with some more widely aplibible concepts soon.

**Tip of the Week**
Finding good information online can be hard. This is one of my favorite sites for learning new programing languages. They have tutorials in many different languages.
